            <h3>General Advice for Business financing</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Explore All Options:</strong> Before applying, consider alternatives like cost reduction, increasing sales, or using contingency funds to meet capital needs. It's always crucial to explore all the options before opting for debt funding. Furthermore, comparing options to find out the cheapest funding source just makes sense.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Plan Loan Usage:</strong> Clearly define how you intend to use the loan for critical business tasks, ensuring immediate and effective deployment of funds. Debt funds sitting idle in the account and not being used efficiently is a form of loss for the business, because you'd be ultimately paying interest on those funds, hence it is imperative to have a plan in place on how you're going to utilize the funds effectively once the loan is secured.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Renewal Opportunities:</strong> If possible, opt for lenders like Lendingkart that offer loan renewals upon repayment for continuous project funding. Loan renewals put the borrower at ease, you can carry forward the remaining amount by renewing the debt term to ensure that you do not have a big obligation in the near future and are able to repay off the financing as per your convenience.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Consult with Experts:</strong> Discuss with financial planners and operational heads to strategize growth and ensure the loan benefits your business. These subject matter experts have unparalleled experience in efficiently managing finances. Getting an opinion would be a smart move as they might have a better understanding and idea on how to efficiently utilize the money while effectively minimizing the cost implication on the business.
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Don'ts of Business financing</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Avoid Excessive Borrowing:</strong> Applying for a high loan amount increases EMI, potentially straining finances during low sales or delayed invoices.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Refrain from Impulse Spending:</strong> Avoid using loan funds for non-essential tasks like paying off existing debts or unplanned purchases that can deplete working capital.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Reconsider Non-Beneficial Loans:</strong> If the loan does not contribute to meaningful business growth, reconsider the necessity of borrowing.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Careful Planning:</strong> Assess the potential financial impact and repayment capability before seeking financing to avoid future financial distress.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Purposeful Investment:</strong> Ensure every capital investment, including loans, aligns with business growth and operational efficiency strategies.

            <div class="news-section">
                <p>The necessity to satisfy working capital demands and ambitious development plans propelled Micro, Small, and Medium-Sized Enterprises (MSMEs) to a sharp increase in credit offtake in the 2023–24 fiscal year. Bank advances reached a decadal high of Rs 10.16 lakh crore, up 19.98% from Rs 8.46 lakh crore in FY2022-23, according to the State Level Bankers' Committee (SLBC) of Gujarat.</p>
                
                <p>The amount of credit made to MSME alone was Rs 2.5 lakh crore, or almost 30% of all advances and 19% more than the Rs 2.13 lakh crore advances made the year before. Strong MSME performance and corporate expansion ambitions, particularly in Gujarat's packaging, engineering, iron and steel, and pharmaceutical sectors, are what drove this rise, according to a senior SLBC official. The Production-Linked Incentive Scheme (PLI) and better balance sheets following the COVID-19 pandemic also contributed to the increase in credit demand. One important factor, according to Pathik Patwari, the former president of the Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GCCI), is the increased working capital needs resulting from late payments.</p>

                <p>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) issued a directive on April 15th that prohibits all banks and regulated entities from imposing additional fees on loans that are not listed in the Key Fact Statement (KFS). This directive is set to take effect from October 1, 2024. The RBI's move aims to enhance transparency and aid borrowers in making informed financial decisions. According to the guidelines, all new retail and MSME term loans sanctioned from the specified date must adhere to these conditions strictly.</p>
                
                <p>The KFS, a crucial document in loan agreements, must be presented in clear language and include all relevant details like fees, charges, and the computation of the annual percentage rate (APR) and amortization schedule. Furthermore, the RBI requires that borrowers provide explicit consent for any charges not pre-listed in the KFS, ensuring that banks and entities cannot levy hidden fees at any stage of the loan. This policy aligns with efforts to empower borrowers and uphold financial fairness.</p>
