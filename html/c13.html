                <h2>Factors that affect Commercial loan EMIs:</h2>
                <p>Business or Commercial loan has been one of the most common methods of borrowing money from external sources like banks and nonbanking financial companies to start a new business venture or expansion of an existing business.</p>
                
                <h3>To begin with, let us understand what a loan is?</h3>
                <p>Loan can be referred to as the money lent to an individual, organization, or other domains by an individual, organization, or financial entity. The recipient of the investment is then liable to pay regular interest on the loan amount as well as repay the principal amount borrowed within a stipulated time frame, by way of EMIs.</p>
                
                <h3>What is an Commercial Loan EMI?</h3>
                <p>An EMI (Equated Monthly Instalment) is a pre-decided fixed amount to be paid on a specific date each month by the borrower of a loan to clear off an outstanding loan within the set-out time frame. An EMI amount includes the interest plus the principal amount accrued on the loan amount.</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Principal borrowed</strong> – The actual loan amount you need to hire to start or expand a business. Higher the principal loan amount higher will be the EMI payable and vice-versa.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Rate of interest</strong> – One of the prime factors affecting the EMI amount is the rate of interest. Higher the rate of interest, higher will be the EMI payable and vice-versa.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Tenure of the loan</strong> – Longer the loan tenure, lower will be the EMI payable. Currently, the longest loan tenure for business loans in India is five years.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Monthly rest period</strong> – Under the monthly rest period, the interest is worked out based on the outstanding loan amount, which means with every EMI that you pay, there is a reduction in interest over time.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Annual rest period</strong> – Under annual rest, even with the payment of regular EMIs, the interest calculated on the loan amount will be re-evaluated only at the end of each year (12 months).
                    </li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>How does the Commercial loan EMI calculator work?</h3>
                <p>For calculation of EMIs using <strong>Commercial loan EMI calculator</strong>, you need to know the below details of the loan:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>The total loan amount</li>
                    <li>Rate of interest charged on the amount</li>
                    <li>The loan tenure</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>The mathematical formula for calculation of Commercial loan EMI is:</p>
                <p>E = P * R * (1+R)^N / ((1+R)^N-1), where;</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>E is EMI (Equated Monthly Instalment)</li>
                    <li>P is the principal loan amount borrowed</li>
                    <li>R is the rate of interest</li>
                    <li>N is the loan tenure in months</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>Step by Step method of calculating EMIs using Commercial loan EMI calculator:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Enter the loan amount for which you want to apply.</li>
                    <li>Enter the rate of interest applicable</li>
                    <li>Select the tenure of the loan as per your repayment convenience</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p>After entering the above details, the commercial loan calculator evaluates the below figures:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Total interest amount payable until the end of your loan tenure.</li>
                    <li>The total amount owed at the end of the mandate, which is the sum of principal and interest.</li>
                    <li>EMIs, which is the equated monthly amount to be paid towards your business loan.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>EMI Calculator</h3>

                            <p>Yes, most lenders allow prepayment of commercial loans after a certain period (usually 6 months) with minimal or no charges. Prepayment can help reduce your total interest burden.</p>
