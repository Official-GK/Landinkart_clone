                        <p>CIBIL Score is a 3-digit numeric summary of your credit history (300-900) that reflects your credit repayment history, utilization, mix, and length of credit history. A higher score indicates better creditworthiness.</p>

                        <p>Yes, we check your CIBIL score as part of our loan evaluation process. However, we consider multiple factors, not just CIBIL. Business performance is equally important, and we may approve loans even with lower scores.</p>
